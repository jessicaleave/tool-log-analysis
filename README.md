# tool-log-analysis
This project simulates manufacturing tool log data and illustrates an end-to-end analytics pipeline â€” including data cleaning, preprocessing, and dashboard visualization using Python-generated mock data. 
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
In manufacturing, **Tool Logs** capture the real-time status of equipmentâ€”such as production, standby, scheduled downtime, and unscheduled downtime. Analyzing this data is key to understanding equipment efficiency, maintenance planning, and operational bottlenecks.

This project includes:

- Python scripts to **generate realistic tool log mock data**
- Optional preprocessing scripts for **data cleaning and event merging**
- A **Tableau dashboard** to visualize trends and highlight anomalies
